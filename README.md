Attack Simulation with Metasploit and Reverse Shell
# 🧰 Tools Used
Kali Linux (attacker) 🐉
Windows (victim) 🪟
VirtualBox 💻
Metasploit Framework 🎯
Nmap 🔍
Python 3 🐍

# 🧪 Steps Performed
# 1️⃣ Virtual machine setup
Two virtual machines (Kali Linux and Windows) were installed and configured in VirtualBox on the same network.

# 2️⃣ Connectivity check 🛰️
Connectivity between the two machines was verified to ensure they could communicate.

# 6️⃣ File download from the victim 📥
The Windows machine accessed the attacker's server and downloaded the payload. However the system detected it was not a normal file.
